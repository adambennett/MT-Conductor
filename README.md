# Conductor

## Installing
1. Click "Manual Download" on [TrainStop]().
2. Inside the downloaded ZIP file. Run the "Conductor Setup X.X.X.exe" (where X represents the version number).
3. Follow the installer steps.
    - Installing to the Monster Train folder will cause problems. DO NOT DO THIS. It's an application, not a mod.
